# Clean Code

## Summary 

> We use the following principles to keep our code clean:

- Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers. (except of constants)
- Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names. (also cleaning up html & css with additional naming conventions)
- Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them Meaningful. (always)
- Write Short Functions That Only Do One Thing. (still have a couple of bigger functions which could be cleaned in the end)
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic.
- Follow Established Code-Writing Standards. (e.g. solid principles)
