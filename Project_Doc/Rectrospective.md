# Retrospective

In our retrospective, we collected our thoughts about what has happened so far, and how we should continue working on our project

- We have discussed about the different technolgies we used; about which of them we like and which we do not want to use again
- We have talked about what went well, as well as how we could have organized better
- We have specified the priorities to focus on during the final project phase
- We have learned to use a Marc (the ancient one) in future projects

Here are our notes of the mentioned points in detail:
