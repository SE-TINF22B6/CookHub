## Test Report
<br>

### 1. Introduction
> This section of the documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the software testing process adopted in our project, focusing specifically on the utilization of GitHub Actions and unit testing with TypeScript. The objective here is to outline the scope of testing activities, ensuring a clear understanding of the methodologies used and the expected outcomes. This will assist developers, testers, and stakeholders to efficiently collaborate and maintain high standards of software quality throughout the development lifecycle.

**Overview of Testing Strategy**  
> We employ an integrated approach to testing, combining automated workflows via GitHub Actions with rigorous unit testing in TypeScript. This strategy is designed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of our testing processes, enabling continuous integration and delivery.

**GitHub Actions**  
> GitHub Actions play a pivotal role in automating our testing pipelines. Every code commit triggers a series of actions that execute automated tests, ensuring that all changes are validated against predefined test cases before integration. This section will detail the setup, configuration, and management of these workflows, alongside best practices for maximizing their effectiveness.

**Unit Testing with TypeScript**  
> Unit tests form the backbone of our testing framework, primarily focusing on the functionality of the smallest parts of the program. Written in TypeScript, these tests provide a robust platform for verifying the logic and behavior of individual modules. We will explore the frameworks and tools used, such as Jest or Mocha, the structure of test cases, and the criteria for writing effective and comprehensive unit tests.

**Scope of Testing Activities**  
> The scope of our testing extends from simple code functionality checks to complex interaction and integration tests, ensuring that every component functions as expected in isolation and in conjunction with others. This section will outline the extent of these activities and the criteria used to define their boundaries and priorities.

**Expected Outcomes**  
> By the end of this section, readers should have a thorough understanding of the testing processes, equipped with the knowledge to execute and improve upon the existing tests. Moreover, the documentation will set expectations for the outcomes of the testing activities, including reliability, performance metrics, and the criteria for success.


### 2. Test Strategy
> This section outlines our overall approach to testing within the project. It covers the methodologies, types of tests, and specific techniques we employ, alongside the rationale behind our selective testing strategy due to limited time and resources.

**Testing Methodology**  
> Our methodology is centered around agile testing practices, which are integrated into the development cycle. This approach allows for continuous testing and immediate feedback, crucial for addressing issues promptly and efficiently. Testing activities are automated as much as possible to streamline the process and minimize manual effort.

**Types of Testing**  
> Given our resource constraints, we focus primarily on the following types of tests:
> 
> - **Unit Testing:** The foundation of our testing efforts, focusing on individual units of code to ensure they function correctly in isolation. These tests are automated through frameworks tailored for TypeScript.
> - **Integration Testing:** Conducted to verify that different modules or services work together as expected. These tests are crucial when new features that depend on existing functionalities are developed.
> - **Regression Testing:** Automated to ensure that recent changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities. These tests are triggered automatically via GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

**Testing Tools and Frameworks**  
> The following tools and frameworks are integral to our testing strategy:

> - **Jest:** Our primary framework for unit testing. It is well-suited for the TypeScript environment, offering robust testing capabilities, mock functions, and asynchronous testing support.
> - **GitHub Actions:** Used for automating our CI/CD pipeline, including running our test suites on every push and pull request. This helps in identifying and resolving issues early in the development cycle.
> - **ESLint:** While primarily a linting tool, ESLint helps ensure that our TypeScript code adheres to best practices and standards, indirectly supporting our testing efforts by reducing the likelihood of bugs.

**Scope Limitations**  
> Due to the constraints of time and resources in our study project, comprehensive testing like full system testing or exhaustive end-to-end testing will not be prioritized. Our focus will remain on critical functionalities and integration points, aiming to maximize our testing impact within the available means.

**Expected Outcomes**  
> The primary objective of our testing strategy is to maintain a high standard of quality for all delivered features, despite the restricted scope. By leveraging automated tools and focusing on key areas of the software, we aim to ensure stability and functionality, minimizing the risk of major defects in the production environment.
>
> This testing strategy is designed to be adaptive and scalable, able to accommodate more comprehensive testing phases as resources become available, ensuring ongoing improvement in the quality and reliability of the software product.
